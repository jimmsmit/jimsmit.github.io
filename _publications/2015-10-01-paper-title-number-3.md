Traditional risk scores like [APACHE IV](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16540951/) provide mortality risk stratification for ICU patients upon admission. Our new study presents a model for dynamic risk stratification throughout the whole ICU stay, validated in the [Dutch Data Warehouse](https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13054-021-03733-z) dataset, with more than 3000 COVID-19 patients admitted to 25 different ICUs in the Netherlands.
