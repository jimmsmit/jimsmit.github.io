Various papers present 'machine learning (ML) models' as complex models that can outperform 'traditional statistical models', such as [<i>Banoei and collegues</i>](https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13054-021-03749-5) in their model for mortality published in <i>Crit Care</i>. On the other hand, the community [warns](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01961-6) for overuse and misuse of ML models, recommending to always benmchmark your performance with "traditional statistical" models.

But where do we draw the line between ML and statistical models? Should we draw one in the first place?

<b>Our stance:</b> Stop categorizing prediction models as being "statistical", "ML" or "AI" models, as there is no clear distinction between them. Different prediction models lie on a continuum regarding flexibility, and it will vary per problem which one will perform the best.

We wrote a [letter](https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13054-021-03868-z) to the editor of <i>Crit Care</i> to discuss this!
