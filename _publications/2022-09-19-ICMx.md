Timely identification of deteriorating COVID-19 patients is needed to guide changes in clinical management and admission to intensive care units (ICUs). There is significant concern that widely used Early warning scores (EWSs) underestimate illness severity in COVID-19 patients and therefore, we developed an early warning model specifically for COVID-19 patients.

We collected electronic medical record data from over 3500 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, admitted to 6 different hospitals in the Netherlands.

To simulate the situation in which the model would have been developed after the first and implemented during the second COVID-19 ‘wave’ in the Netherlands, we performed a temporal validation by splitting all included patients into groups admitted before and after August 1, 2020. Furthermore, we propose a method for dynamic model updating to retain model performance over time (see figure below).

The model showed a higher discriminative performance compared to traditional Early Warning Scores (ie the National early warning score aka NEWS and the Modified early warning score aka MEWS).
